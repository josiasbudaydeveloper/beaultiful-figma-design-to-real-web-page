# Beaultiful Figma web design to real web page

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a project where I get to exercise my CSS skills through turning a Figma design into a real Web page with Responsive Web Design.
